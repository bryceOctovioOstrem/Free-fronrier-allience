frigjoring,CUSTOM,"
Frigjoring experiences a harsh continental climate, marked by long, frigid winters and brief, warm summers. The landscape is rich in rivers, wetlands, and permafrost, forming a delicate ecosystem. However, industrial expansion and climate changeâ€”particularly the thawing of permafrostâ€”pose serious threats to this fragile environment. The nation's heavy reliance on refining has resulted in an over-specialized export economy, leaving it highly susceptible to global market fluctuations. In times of economic hardship, desperation has driven people to extreme measuresâ€”there are even accounts of men killing neighbors over a winter coat.
"
isencao,CUSTOM,"Isencao was a failed Domain-era experiment, seeded with engineered lifeforms meant to cleanse pollution by consuming it. Instead, the ecosystem adapted to thrive in the toxic output of a runaway nano-forge, mutating into an uncontrollable, hyper-aggressive jungle. The planet is now a nightmare of biomass, where survival depends on ethanol flamethrowers and electrified fences just to keep the foliage at bay. The more exotic flora are refined into some of the most profitable—and dangerous—designer drugs in the sector. Isencao now serves the Free Frontier Alliance—its industries powered by a vast population of genetically modified work beasts.

opertunidad,CUSTOM,"Oportunidad is a harsh, arid world dominated by endless deserts and scorched mesas. Most of its inhabitants eke out a living in isolated mining towns, where justice is swift and often delivered from the barrel of a gun. Beneath its sun-baked sands lies an unusually vast reserve of goldâ€”so abundant that it shapes the planetâ€™s art, architecture, and industry. Yet even here, water is more precious than gold.
Once decivilized during the First AI War, Oportunidad was shattered by saturation bombardments that left its surface scarred and its societies in ruins. It has since been resettled, though much of the interior remains lawless. A population of so-called ""natives"" endures by raiding more developed, cosmopolitan enclaves, continuing a cycle of survival carved from violence.
Oportunidad is not for the faint of heart. It is a hard world fit only for hard people.
"
rapture,CUSTOM,"The capital world of the FFA, Rapture is a water covered world with a few widespread tropical islands. Rapture is one of the few planets where you can see Domain era Style Aquaculture. The harvest is turned into heavily processed , delicious and incredibly unhealthy food. Most of the population live on the ocean floor In giant underwater city as the island are the sites of the most expensive beach side resorts in the sector. Rapture is the mecha of party life if you can afford it and avoid the gangsters and addiction zombies. Residents of rapture are advised to remain armed at all times. If you don't want to be hunted by Hegemony authorities : what happenes on Rapture stays on Rapture. "
thalb,CUSTOM,"The planet Thalb is the private dominion of the Heinze family, a world governed by a rigid system of neo-feudalism. Here, miners toil as the equivalent of peasants, service workers function as freemen, corporate security forces serve as modern-day knights, and regional managers wield authority akin to that of feudal lordsâ€”answering only to Queen Augusta herself. The entire planet operates as a colossal company town.
A constant influx of desperate migrants from across the sector arrive on Thalb, fleeing debt, chaos, or lawlessness. They seek refugeâ€”and employmentâ€”in the planetâ€™s volatile extraction industry, where there is always work, if little else.
While the rest of the Free Frontier Alliance views Thalbâ€™s management with deep contempt, no formal violations of the Non-Aggression Pact (NAP) have been recorded. Thus, Queen Augustaâ€™s rule continues, unchallenged by law.
"
LIB_aquinas,SHIP,"Chiron Kirk, Head of Supreme Solutions, stared grimly at the datapad, his jaw clenched as three Milie-class ships were torn apart by the relentless barrages of an Invictus-class warship. With a sharp breath, he tapped the microphone embedded in his desk.
“Connect me to the Research Department,” he said coldly. “We have work to do.”
In response to the Luddic Church’s reintroduction of the formidable Invictus-class into the sector, Supreme Solutions unveiled the Aquinas-class—a warship engineered to meet overwhelming force with precision and power. Designed with unmatched frontal firepower and reinforced armor, the Aquinas sacrifices broadside capabilities in favor of a devastating head-on assault profile. Passenger accommodations rival those of a royal palace, offering unparalleled luxury. Most notably, the ship operates with minimal human presence, relying instead on a fully integrated, artificially grown programmable brain to fulfill the roles traditionally assigned to crew.

"
LIB_cebeci,SHIP,
LIB_celestial_empress,SHIP,"The Celestial Empress-class was the crown jewel of Pinnacle Aerospaceâ€”an icon of interstellar luxury and the most sought-after vessel of Pinnacle Aerospace prior to the Collapse. These majestic cruise liners embodied unmatched splendor, designed not for war, but for wonder. Within their gilded hulls lay a world of indulgence: grand casinos glittering beneath chandeliers of starlight, opulent theaters echoing with symphonies, private tennis courts suspended in artificial gravity, vast banquet halls fit for emperors, and three stratified tiers of passengers, each experiencing their own curated realm of extravagance.
Unburdened by weapons or armor, the Celestial Empress-class vessels relied solely on their breathtaking velocityâ€”engines so advanced they could outrun nearly any threat. In every sense, these ships were not just transportâ€”they were temples of excess, monuments to a bygone age of ambition, beauty, and boundless human aspiration.

LIB_Commandante,SHIP,The praetorian class are long range missile command cruisers. The class has extensive missile complement and a large operations center. The ship class contains all the amenities and luxuries that befits an executive or admiral. It even has a small water park so that one can blast your enemies to dust while getting tanned with a cocktail. The class uses an artificially grown programmable brain to handle most tasks performed by a traditional crew. 
LIB_competitor,SHIP," The competitor class is the first warship design by Pinnacle Aerospace. Itâ€™s an incredibly fast frigate with good forward facing firepower, but lacking in defences. This ship is run by an artificially grown mind and this does not need a human crew. The designers took full advantage of this to increase the frigate speed. The competitors' success set the model for future Pinnacle Aerospace warships.
The head of the Persean branch of Pinnacle Aerospace stared at the two screens in front of him . One had a summary on how to create technically legal sub-sabient brains discovered by the research and development department. The other was a proposal to design for a warship. Pinnacle Aerospace made cruise ships not war ships. Moving into the defence industry would contradict Pinnacle Aerospace reputation for class, luxury and professionalism. Then he remembered the abysmal performance review he had to give a few days ago. There was little need for luxury starships in this new dark age. He approved the proposal. 
"
LIB_Coustillier,SHIP,"The Coustillier-class heavy cruisers combine high-speed maneuverability with formidable firepower, making them a dominant force in any fleet.

LIB_tolkien,SHIP,"The Feanor-class battlecruisers are immensely powerful warships, renowned for their devastating forward firepower, exceptional speed, and formidable shielding. Thanks to an integrated human brain piloting system, each ship requires only a single crew member to operate. A built-in self-destruct mechanism and an emergency escape shuttle minimize the risk of capture.
The class was conceived by Elizabeth Rinehart, a wealthy and eccentric former mining executive, and constructed by Mythical Manufacturing, whose engineers were captivated by the blueprintâ€™s novel crystalline armor. When the first ship of the line was launched, a grand ceremony marked the occasion. At its climax, Rinehart boldly proclaimed herself ""Queen Protector of the Free Frontier Alliance""â€”then stunned all present by having her brain surgically removed and installed into the flagship, FFAN Feanor.
Rinehart, now permanently integrated into her creation, embarked on a ruthless privateering campaign against the Luddic Path and Sindrian Diktat. Her exploits earned her semi-official recognition from the Free Frontier Alliance, who treated her as a state-sanctioned mercenaryâ€”provided she occasionally took ""advice"" from her ""subjects.""
"
LIB_Yahweh,SHIP,"The Yahweh-Class Universal Dreadnought is the newest and most advanced warship line from Mythic Manufacturing-an apex of ship design capable of fulfilling (almost) any role. Like all cutting-edge models in the Mythic fleet, Yahweh dreadnoughts are piloted by a single human brain suspended in a nutrient tank, eliminating the need for a traditional crew and streamlining operational control.

Each unit comes standard with a backup command deck( in case a brain cannot be found) and a self-destruct system (to prevent capture). Despite its grand title, the ""Universal Dreadnought"" designation is mostly marketing flair-the ship offers only limited personnel transport capacity. But as the 239th Rule of Acquisition reminds us: ""Never be afraid to mislabel a product."""
LIB_arm_flame,WEAPON,"An effective long-range chemical projector designed to disperse flammable compounds across distant targets. While various fuels can be used, the majority of admirals opt for the cost-efficient Fourth Generation biofuel sourced from Isencao."

Built around a time-tested blowback firing mechanism dating back to the days of Old Earth, this weapon maintains exceptional reliability in even the harshest conditions. Its safety features include a positive cook-off prevention system for open-bolt clearing and a double-ram safeguard to prevent malfunctions.
Interestingly, this design emerged independently across multiple mining fleets and refinery operators. The distinctive gold plating is an artistic use of the otherwise low-value metal commonly extracted by mining fleets as excess.
All the parts can be 3D-printed using a micro civilian forge-vat, with blueprints freely available on the Stellar Net. After all, the right to own automatic machine guns is a natural right."
LIB_gold_triple_machine_gun,WEAPON,"The gold-plated triple heavy machine gun is a rugged and reliable weapon designed for point defense, much like its smaller counterpart. This variant is a triple version of the standard heavy machine gun used across the sector, optimized for maximum firepower.
This weapons system features a reliable blowback firing mechanism said to date back to the days of Old Earth. Safety features include a positive cook-off safety for open bolt clearing and double ram prevention. The weapon is typically mounted on a relatively heavy base to help absorb recoil during prolonged bursts of fire.
This design was invented by a rich gun enthusiast on the planet of Jefferson. He posted videos documenting most of the process in the hope of revitalizing weapon innovation across the sector.
Most of the parts can be 3D-printed using a micro civilian forge-vat, with blueprints freely available on the Stellar Net. After all, the right to own automatic machine guns is a natural right.

FFA,FACTION,"""Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow?""
The Free Frontier Alliance is a confederacy with a highly decentralized system of governance, designed to protect individual rights while minimizing state interference. The government exists primarily to enforce contracts, adjudicate disputes, and provide defense against existential threats. Welfare and government utilities are a Foreign concept to the citizens of the Alliance. The lower classes have one of the lowest standards of living, while the rich enjoy luxury that would make the kings of old envious.
Formerly a member of the Persean League, the Free Frontier Alliance left over the increasing power and imperialism of Kazeron. Also being forced to pay 20% of gdp in union dues (taxes).
The Alliance thrives as an economic powerhouse. It is home to nomadic trade fleets, dystopian cyberpunk megacities, and utopian homesteads. Most of the unskilled labor is handled by vat grown ,(legally) sub sentient, work beasts. Much to the disgust of the alliance's working class and the rest of the sector. 
With no standing military, the Alliance relies on a combination of private defense agencies, mercenary outfits, and volunteer militias. These organizations operate on a contractual basis, responding to pirate incursions, rogue AI threats, or external invasions. These forces are famous for looting everything of value when outside of the alliance's borders.
What little law enforcement happens in the alliance is done by for profit law enforcement firms. While highly efficient, less prosperous areas are effectively lawless due to being unable to afford these services. 
Alliance citizens value self-reliance, innovation, and voluntary cooperation. They are fiercely independent, often enhancing themselves with cybernetic augmentations or gene mods to compete in high-risk, high-reward industries. A common phrase in the Compact is “The stars belong to the bold.”
