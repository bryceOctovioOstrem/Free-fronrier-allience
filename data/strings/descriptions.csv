LIB_tolkien,SHIP,"The Feanor-class battlecruisers are immensely powerful warships, renowned for their devastating forward firepower, exceptional speed, and formidable shielding. Thanks to an integrated human brain piloting system, each ship requires only a single crew member to operate. A built-in self-destruct mechanism and an emergency escape shuttle minimize the risk of capture.
The class was conceived by Elizabeth Rinehart, a wealthy and eccentric former mining executive, and constructed by Mythical Manufacturing, whose engineers were captivated by the blueprint’s novel crystalline armor. When the first ship of the line was launched, a grand ceremony marked the occasion. At its climax, Rinehart boldly proclaimed herself ""Queen Protector of the Free Frontier Alliance""—then stunned all present by having her brain surgically removed and installed into the flagship, FFAN Feanor.
Rinehart, now permanently integrated into her creation, embarked on a ruthless privateering campaign against the Luddic Path and Sindrian Diktat. Her exploits earned her semi-official recognition from the Free Frontier Alliance, who treated her as a state-sanctioned mercenary—provided she occasionally took ""advice"" from her ""subjects.""

LIB_aquinas,SHIP,"Chiron Kirk, Head of Supreme Solutions, stared grimly at the datapad, his jaw clenched as three Milie-class ships were torn apart by the relentless barrages of an Invictus-class warship. With a sharp breath, he tapped the microphone embedded in his desk.
“Connect me to the Research Department,” he said coldly. “We have work to do.”
In response to the Luddic Church’s reintroduction of the formidable Invictus-class into the sector, Supreme Solutions unveiled the Aquinas-class—a warship engineered to meet overwhelming force with precision and power. Designed with unmatched frontal firepower and reinforced armor, the Aquinas sacrifices broadside capabilities in favor of a devastating head-on assault profile. Passenger accommodations rival those of a royal palace, offering unparalleled luxury. Most notably, the ship operates with minimal human presence, relying instead on a fully integrated, artificially grown programmable brain to fulfill the roles traditionally assigned to crew.

LIB_competitor,SHIP," The competitor class is the first warship design by Pinnacle Aerospace. It’s an incredibly fast frigate with good forward facing firepower, but lacking in defences. This ship is run by an artificially grown mind and this does not need a human crew. The designers took full advantage of this to increase the frigate speed. The competitors' success set the model for future Pinnacle Aerospace warships.
The head of the Persean branch of Pinnacle Aerospace stared at the two screens in front of him . One had a summary on how to create technically legal sub-sabient brains discovered by the research and development department. The other was a proposal to design for a warship. Pinnacle Aerospace made cruise ships not war ships. Moving into the defence industry would contradict Pinnacle Aerospace reputation for class, luxury and professionalism. Then he remembered the abysmal performance review he had to give a few days ago. There was little need for luxury starships in this new dark age. He approved the proposal.
